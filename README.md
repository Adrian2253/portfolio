### Projects 
- Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis
    - Description: This project analyzes a publicly available dataset on direct marketing campaigns conducted by a bank. The campaigns involved phone calls to clients, aiming to determine whether they would subscribe to a term deposit (target       variable: ‘y’, with values ‘yes’/‘no’).
    - Key Aspects of the Dataset:
       - Over 45,000 records with 16 features
       - Client Information: Age, job, education, marital status, bank balance, loan status, etc.
       - Last Contact Details: Contact type, duration, day, and month.
       - Campaign History: Number of contacts in the current and previous campaigns, days since last contact, and previous campaign outcome.
    - Project Goals:
       - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify trends and insights from the dataset.
       - Feature Engineering & Preprocessing: Handle missing data, categorical encoding, and scaling.
       - Predictive Modeling: Build classification models  Decision Trees and Random Fores to predict whether a client will subscribe to the deposit.
       - Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.
